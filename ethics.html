    <h1> Ethics in IT </h1>
    <p> A clear understanding of ethics and moral grounds in Information Technology(IT) is essential. According to an article by Marymount University, which Alexandra Dauchess wrote, IT ethics refers to the moral principles that guide the behavior of people who interact with technology and related organizations that develop or implement technology.</p>
    <p> With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence and various serious cases of deepfakes and social engineering, many have raised questions related to IT ethics. However, with evolving technological advancements, concerns will be increasing, but as an individual, if we follow some general guidelines related to IT ethics, then it would be more of an issue. The guidelines are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
        <li>Being honest and transparent while developing a technology.</li>
        <li>IT professionals must act with integrity and be responsible for the consequences caused by their actions.</li>
        <li> IT professionals and organizations must keep the technology development process and steps confidential to avoid future cyberattacks on them and their products.</li>
        <li> IT professionals must respect intellectual property.</li>
    </ul>
